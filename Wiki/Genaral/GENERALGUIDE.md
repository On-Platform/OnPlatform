## General Guide

1. One should always use the [Discussions](https://github.com/On-Platform/OnPlatform/discussions) rather than communicating via untracable media when `discussing` a `Feature`, `New Idea`, `Enhancement`, `Change`.
2. This is a `Open project`, No one has direct ownership except `public opinion`. `Respect` and `be agile`.
3. Never force someone to keep working unless they want to.
4. Be generous and get used to view `daily updates` and `notification` regarding the On-Platform and `update accodingly`.
5. If you are unable to contribute for a significant period of time, be responsible enough to `update the team`.
6. Sole purpose of this Open Project is to let everyone `experience` what they want, which they can't experience alone due to various reasons. And to build up their `Portfolio` by `contributing` in this project in the areas which they like to. But sometimes you may have to `compromise` just make sure that the project flow won't get stuck, making sure that you be `responsible` and play your part accodingly for the time being.
