## Developer's Guide

1. Developer must always let the maintainer know before you start working on a certain `Project, Repository, Application`.
2. Developer must always create a `Idea` in the [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/On-Platform/discussions/categories/ideas) and be approved of the idea before you start working on a new `App or a concept`.
3. Follow [Standard](https://github.com/On-Platform/OnPlatform/tree/master/Wiki/Standards) when creating and Naming a `Repository`.
