## Developer's Guide

1. Developer must always let the maintainer know before you start working on a certain `Project, Repository, Application`.
2. Developer must always create a `Idea` in the [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/On-Platform/discussions/categories/ideas) and be approved of the idea before you start working on it. A new `App, Concept, Feature or Change`.
3. Follow [Standards](https://github.com/On-Platform/OnPlatform/blob/master/Wiki/Standards/REPOSITORY.md) when creating and Naming a `Repository`.
4. Due to certain limitation of the Orginization Account Subscription, We have lack of feature to setup branch rules. To prevent we have set the default branch to `main` and one must never checkout the `master` branch to local environment. This is to prevent accidental direct push to `master` branch.
5. Developer much never direct push to `main` branch. Instead create a `pull request` to the `main` and wait for code reviewer to `review` the code and merge the pull requiest.
6. If you are a `Code reviewer` you should never merge a branch before `status checks` complete or fails.
7. You should always follow `Industry Standards` and `Best Practices` when implementing a feature or writing a code.
8. To maintain the Perfomance of the and User expirience the following Frameworks are `disallowed`.
    + `ReactNative`
9. To prevent `dereliction` of a project due to lack of `resource`, a project funding a `new Language` or a `Framwork` should atleast have `two` capable resources before starting.
